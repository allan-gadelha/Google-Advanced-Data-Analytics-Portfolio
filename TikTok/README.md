# TikTok Claim Classification Project

Welcome to your new role at TikTok! This project focuses on the development of a predictive model to classify claims and opinions within TikTok videos and comments. As a data analyst on the TikTok data team, your insights and contributions will play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of handling user reports.

## Project Goal

TikTok aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. The successful implementation of this model will help reduce the backlog of user reports, allowing for more efficient moderation.

## Project Background

TikTok’s data team is in the early stages of the claims classification project. Before diving into data analysis, the following tasks need to be accomplished:

- Create a project proposal with organized milestones.
- Classify tasks using the PACE workflow.
- Identify relevant stakeholders.

## Team Members at TikTok
