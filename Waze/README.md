# Waze User Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to your new role at Waze! In this project, we aim to analyze user data and develop a machine learning model that predicts monthly user churn. As a data analyst on the Waze data team, your insights will play a crucial role in preventing churn, improving user retention, and contributing to Waze's business growth.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts monthly user churn on the Waze app. The insights gained from the model will help optimize Waze's retention strategy, enhance user experience, and inform data-driven decisions for product development.
