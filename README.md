## Projects

### 1. Automatidata (Fictional Data Consulting Firm)

You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata’s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions. In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. Your first responsibility as a data analytics consultant will be to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project. 

### 2. TikTok (Partnership)

As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, with new considerations from the leadership team, you will create a project proposal by assigning the required data analytical tasks into realistic milestones that will advise future steps in the claims classification project.

### 3. Waze (Partnership)

You are the newest member of Waze’s data team. Your team is about to begin their user churn project. The first step is to create a project proposal. The proposal will clearly define the overall goal of the project, and identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders.
